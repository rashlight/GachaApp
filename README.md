# Gacha App
![Build status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-idk%20do%20it%20yourself-blue?style=flat&logo=visual-studio)

Some games I've been making in my spare time, mostly about randomness.

## Releases
Download the binaries [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/rashlight/GamblingApp/tree/master/Binaries).
You'll need [.NET 4.6 framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49982) for this to work. 

## Build from source
Open "GachaApp.sln" in /path/to/GachaApp and build from there. Visual Studio 2019 or more is recommended.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Major bugs or huge changes in codebase should be discussed in Issues first.
